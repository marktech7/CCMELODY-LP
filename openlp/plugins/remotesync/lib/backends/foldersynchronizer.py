    The FolderSynchronizer uses xml-files in a simple holder structure for synchronizing data.
    The folder-structure looks like this:
    <base-folder>
    +---songs
    |   +---history
    |   +---deleted
    +---customs
    |   +---history
    |   +---deleted
    +---services
    The files are named after the uuid generated for each song or custom slide, the id of the
    OpenLP instance and the version of the song, like this: {uuid}={version}={computer_id}.xml
    An example could be: bd5bc6c2-4fd2-4a42-925f-48d00de835ec=4=churchpc1.xml
    When a file is updated a lock file is created to signal that the song is locked. The filename
    of the lock file is: {uuid}.lock={computer_id}={version}
    As part of the updating of the file, the old version is moved to the appropriate history folder.
    When a song/custom slide is deleted, its file is moved to the history-folder, and an empty file
    named as the items uuid is placed in the deleted-folder.
